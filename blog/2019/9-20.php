    <p class="text-left">9/20/2019</p>
    <p>So a friend sent me an article the other day titled, "Lack of ‘economically-attractive’ men to blame for decline in marriage". My first thought was "wow, I thought marriage was about love." My second thought was, "This has to be related to the economic situation of millennials." So I sat back and tried to think of all my college buddies and what they were doing in life today, 10 years later. Were they still just being 'lazy millennials'?...</p>

	<p>My best friend the last 2 years I was at the university graduated with a bachelors degree in communications. He was a track athlete and also a top running back at his community college before transferring in. We still talk several times per year and while he made some small successes with his side projects (male modeling and acting), his professional life was as equal or worse off than mine. He too has "job hopped" from Vitamin Shop assistant manager, to part time tobacco products rep, GNC supplement salesman, and most recently Grub Hub food delivery driver. Mostly all minimum wage jobs or slightly above. Not a lazy millennial, but this male model is 'economically unattractive.'</p>

	<p>My best friend from high school likewise has had it rough. This man graduated with a bachelors degree in "mechanical engineering technology." He then realized that he picked the wrong major since the "technology" part of his degree made him practically unhirable in the modern professional workplace. For a year after graduating in 2011, he applied for new jobs daily. He got interviews but no buyers, so he kept working as a cook at the pizza restaurant that supported him through college. I was able to get him a job where I worked. Slightly better than minimum wage but at least he was out of the restaurant career. He worked this manual labor job for years after I left. Since then (and after hundreds of applications), he was recently hired as a delivery driver for Lowes home improvement store. I worked as this man's direct supervisor and can vouch that he is definitely not a 'lazy millennial', but nonetheless he falls into the category of 'economically unattractive'.</p>

	<p>These are the two men I am closest with. College educated and hard working. But for some reason they just can't get the break they need and each year it seems farther and farther out of reach. Many of my less close friends enlisted into the military after receiving their bachelors degrees, went to work in high turnover call centers, or took manual labor jobs to pay the bills. Something quite funny is that my high school friends who dropped out, decided not to go to college, or went to tech school instead are all doing fairly well for themselves financially. Unfortunately for these men they have found that the lack of a bachelors degree has also disqualified them for marriage to many women who see "education" as a requirement.</p>

	<p>A girl I once dated told me that she met a man who owned a construction business. He drove a brand new truck and was financially well off. But her friends convinced her to dump him because he didn't have a bachelors degree like her. Mind you she had a bachelors degree in social work and worked in a restaurant as a waitress herself. None the less, like the article says, a woman with a bachelors degree sees a man with less education than her as unattractive.</p>

	<p>So what does this all mean? Well it means that millennial men no matter how hard they work, how physically attractive they are, or what education they receive, will most likely end up in this "economically unattractive" category. It's a realization that is causing many men to 'drop out' of society. This study states that being "economically attractive" is a man who earns at least 58% more income than the woman . In this age of equality and fight for equal pay for women, how can men and women across the board receive equal pay yet still we can have enough men making significantly more money than the women for marriage. A mind boggling conundrum. The study notions that even though many women want equal pay across the board (claimed 70 cents per dollar today), many only consider a man marriage worthy (economically attractive) if he makes on average 58% more than her (ie more than 1 dollar per her 70 cents).</p>

	<p>Regardless of the politics or social beliefs, this article points out something very serious. Millennial men are struggling in this modern economy. And that struggle is seriously affecting their lives to the point of mate selection. A devastating consequence if you consider marriage and reproduction a man's most important life event. The impact on birth rates and marriage rates have been written in stone. Being "economically unattractive" has caused many men to basically give up entirely and go MGTOW. A movement where men stop dating and focus on their hobbies. Other men have decided to leave the west and go to areas where they are seen as more 'economically attractive' by foreign women. This running away is something that a western woman are likely unable to do. If a woman in the United States or Europe in her physical prime cannot find a suitable man (economically attractive) where she resides, she is likely no going to find him by traveling anywhere else in the world (at least while the dollar is still strong).</p>

	<p>This is not to single out the pity of millennial men. Lets not forget the impact on millennial women. Many are now reaching middle age as single women and without children or families. Many are choosing an 'economically attractive' option of a much older man. Many are adopting pet families of cats and dogs, or replacing a family with their career. And many are staying serially monogamous. A situation where they go from relationship to relationship with a few failed engagements along the way but no serious commitment.</p>

	<p>With more women now graduating from college than men, it is only a matter of time before women in the large cities begin to out-earn men on average. Sadly I do not see millennial men becoming 'economically attractive' as a whole any time soon. What this means for the United States and the western world is still unknown. Will the idea of marriage disappear entirely? Will millennial women end up marrying with men many years older than themselves? Will men in large masses exodus the western world to places where they ARE considered economically attractive?  A very interesting time we are in socially for the millennial generation. I suppose we will have to wait and see what happens!</p>
