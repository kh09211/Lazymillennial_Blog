    <p>Since it's September 11th and I finally have my website coded well enough to start uploading content, I thought that I would share a typical 9/11 story. Something similar to the JFK assasination where we tell others were we were and what we were doing when we heard the news. I know it's cliche to say this but I really do remember it almost like it was yesterday. It's hard to imagine that it has already been 18 years ago to this day....</p>

    <p>It was a normal morning at my high school and I was sitting in my first period classroom. It was Civics class with Mrs. Duncan. All of a sudden an anouncement was made over the intercom. "Attention teachers, please turn your televisions on. A plane has just hit the world trade center." We turned the TV on and sure enough there was the smoke coming out of the World Trade Center. They were talking about it being an accident and then shortly after, a huge fireball erupted from the other tower. It was total confusion. Within just a short time later, we saw camera footage of smoke coming from the pentagon.</p>

    <p>There was no mistake at that point what was going on. The USA was under attack. Nobody knew who or why at the time and the speculations started. Was it the Chineese? Islamic radicalist? Homegrown terrorist? Of course we would later learn as Bin Ladin openly took credit for the attacks.</p><p>
    Throughout the rest of the day, we had practically no school work. We went from class to class with our eyes glued to the television screens. Some classes we had discussions about what this meant and how we felt about it. Not long before the end of the day, a second anouncement came over the intercom. They said "Robins Air Force Base is now on Defcon Delta." Robins AFB was the local base and the largest employer of our little town. This meant that nobody could leave or get on to the military base. They said students who could not get home could wait at the school. It was not until after 8pm that the parents could leave the bas to pick up their children.</p>

    <p>Looking back after writing this article, it does seems to be a long time ago. Something that rings very true is what my Social Studies teacher said to us that day. He said "Look kidos, the 90s are over. You grew up in a time of a booming economy where everything was great. There is now going to be a war and your lives are going to be tough from here on out." I actually scoffed at this man's comment. But he was EXACTLY right on the money. Wars and a brutal economic decade lay shortly ahead for us millennials.</p>
