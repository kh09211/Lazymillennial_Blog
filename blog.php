        <p>So it's been a little bit since I last posted an update. The truth is, I've been working pretty hard on some coding projects. Soon I will be adding a WebDev tab to the navigation bar to show off a few things I've been working on. I've also moved the hosted server of this domain from a free hosting site, to my own EC2 instance that I set up in the Amazon AWS cloud. It was a really fun project and now I have much more control over the site...</p>

        <img src="blog/2019/9-20/9-20-1.JPG" style="width: 300px;" alt="screenshot" class="border border-dark">
        <p>So a friend sent me an article the other day titled, "Lack of ‘economically-attractive’ men to blame for decline in marriage". My first thought was "wow, I thought marriage was about love." My second thought was, "This has to be related to the economic situation of millennials." So I sat back and tried to think of all my college buddies and what they were doing in life today, 10 years later. Were they still just being 'lazy millennials'?...</p>

        <p>Driving up to the job fair, we begin to see a long line of people at least an 1/8th of a mile long from the front door and wrapping around the side of the building. I was on my lunch break from my current dead end job hoping to get a chance to apply for Kumho Tire, a factory that was opening up in another city about 20 minutes from my home town. We parked then followed the line to its end...</p>

        <img src="blog/2019/9-11/9-11-1.jpg" style="width: 300px;" alt="motorbicycle" class="border border-dark">
        <p>Since it's September 11th and I finally have my website coded well enough to start uploading content, I thought that I would share a typical 9/11 story. Something similar to the JFK assasination where we tell others were we were and what we were doing when we heard the news. I know it's cliche to say this but I really do remember it almost like it was yesterday. It's hard to imagine that it has already been 18 years ago to this day....</p>
