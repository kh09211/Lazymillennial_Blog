        <p>So it's been a little bit since I last posted an update. The truth is, I've been working pretty hard on some coding projects. Soon I will be adding a WebDev tab to the navigation bar to show off a few things I've been working on. I've also moved the hosted server of this domain from a free hosting site, to my own EC2 instance that I set up in the Amazon AWS cloud. It was a really fun project and now I have much more control over the site...</p>

        <p>I finally had it! My first big bore 1000cc+ motorcycle. Sure I noticed it had a few things rigged here and there, but I could ride it home and I could probably fix it up fine! That night after removing the tank and airbox, I started panicking as I noticed problem after problem with this bike. I decided to take it out on a short little ride and suddenly heard a clack clack clack BANG as the bike threw itself out of gear and revved up into a false neutral. What have I gotten myself into?...</p>

        <p>So a friend sent me an article the other day titled, "Lack of ‘economically-attractive’ men to blame for decline in marriage". My first thought was "wow, I thought marriage was about love." My second thought was, "This has to be related to the economic situation of millennials." So I sat back and tried to think of all my college buddies and what they were doing in life today, 10 years later. Were they still just being 'lazy millennials'?...</p>

        <p>What is megasquirt? It's a fully customizable standalone computer that is mostly used to control fuel injection and electronic ignition systems on automotive engines. That said it can be configured to control or retrofit fuel injection and electronic ignition for practically any engine (even a lawn mower) and has even been used as a PLC for industrial equipment. Let me show you my build and how it works....</p>

        <p>Driving up to the job fair, we begin to see a long line of people at least an 1/8th of a mile long from the front door and wrapping around the side of the building. I was on my lunch break from my current dead end job hoping to get a chance to apply for Kumho Tire, a factory that was opening up in another city about 20 minutes from my home town. We parked then followed the line to its end...</p>

        <p>Since it's September 11th and I finally have my website coded well enough to start uploading content, I thought that I would share a typical 9/11 story. Something similar to the JFK assasination where we tell others were we were and what we were doing when we heard the news. I know it's cliche to say this but I really do remember it almost like it was yesterday. It's hard to imagine that it has already been 18 years ago to this day....</p>
